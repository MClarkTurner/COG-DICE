# COG-DICE
The Continuous Observation Graph-Based Direct Cross Entropy Algorithm is a continuous observation Dec-POMDP solver. COG-DICE is an extension on the G-DICE algorithm for solving discrete Dec-POMDP problems.

In order to implement the code run the makefiles in each of the directories and then call the sh script in the parent directories
